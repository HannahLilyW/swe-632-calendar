# Deliverables for HW3:
1. Have margin between edit and delete buttons
2. only show events + tasks if > 0
3. error recovery in forms
4. cursor pointer in correct places
5. borders around days
6. dates from previous and next months should look different
7. error recovery in forms (duplicate)
8. edit broken (done)
9. events spanning multiple days (won't fix)
10. help/instructions page (maybe won't do)
11. error recovery in forms (duplicate)
12. toasts for saving/editing/deleting
13. edit broken (done)
14. no confirmation for delete
15. recurring events (maybe won't do)

# Nice to have:
Standardize day modal
